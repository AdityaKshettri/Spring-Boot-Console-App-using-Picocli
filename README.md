In this project, I have worked on spring boot to create a console app using pico-cli.

# How to run :

1. First we will generate the jar file in target folder.

$ mvn clean install

2. Open the terminal and run the commands one by one :

$ java -jar target\picocli-app-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar command1 -x=aditya

$ java -jar target\picocli-app-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar command2 1 2 3 4

3. You commands will run successfully.
